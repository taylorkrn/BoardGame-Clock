## A React-App with Arrays, useState, useRef and useEffect

The Board Game works as follows:

- A game is set up with the amount of players and time allowed
- The user is then given the possibility to set the Player Names
- The Countdown Clocks begin, with the next button stopping the current timer and beginning the next
- At the end of each round, the user has the possibility to edit the order of players
- When a timer comes to 0, it turns red and begins to count upwards

This project introduced me to using Arrays, useState, useRef and useEffect in React. Through the undertaking of this website I developed a deeper understanding of re-rendering.

The website is deployed at: https://boardgame-clock.surge.sh/
